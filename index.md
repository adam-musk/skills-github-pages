title: Welcome to my blog

I have been writing here in this blog and I do like writing here. I try to do it as often as I can. I do try to vary my topics as much as possible. I don’t want people to get bored with what I write. My favorite colors are green and purple, which is something I don’t think I’ve said here before. I like to drink coffee in the morning and eat salad for lunch.
